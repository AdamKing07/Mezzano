#Mezzano, an operating system written in Common Lisp.

[![Picture of Emacs REPL](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46753018/Screenshot%20from%202016-03-12%2014%3A36%3A55.png)](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/46753018/Screenshot%20from%202016-03-12%2014%3A36%3A55.png)

`C-<key>` means to hold the control key while typing `<key>`.

`M-<key>` means to hold the alt or meta key while typing `<key>`.

Alphabetic keys typed with control or meta ignore case. `C-A` and `C-a` are the same key, while `C-!` and `C-1` are different.

The default keymap is En-GB, use M-F12 to switch between En-GB, En-US, No-BK, PanCyr, and German keymaps. Windows can be moved by holding the Alt key and dragging.

For help & support, join #mezzano on Freenode (irc.freenode.net)

`M-Esc` will attempt to interrupt the thread associated with the current window.
This won't work if the thread is stuck in a tight loop or if the thread is blocked.

#Line editing
===
The line editor supports most standard line navigation and editing commands.

`C-F`          Move forward (right) one character, also bound to Right-Arrow.

`C-B`          Move backward (left) one character, also bound to Left-Arrow.

`C-A`          Move to beginning of line, also bound to Home.

`C-E`          Move to end of line, also bound to End.

`M-F`          Move forward one word.

`M-B`          Move backward one word.

`M-P`          Find previous (older) matching history item, also bound to Up-Arrow.

`M-N`          Find next (newer) matching history item, also bound to Down-Arrow.

#Editor commands
===

`C-K`          Kill characters from the point to the end of the line, or kill

the newline if the point is at the end of the line.

`C-X C-X`      Swap the point and the mark.

`C-X C-F`      Open or create a file.

`C-X C-S`      Save the current buffer. If the buffer has no path, you will be prompted for a location to save it.

`C-X C-W`      Save the current buffer with a new path.

`C-X b`        Switch to a different buffer.

`C-X C-B`      List buffers.

`C-X k`        Close an open buffer.

`C-G`          Abort the current command.

`C-C C-C`      Evaluate the current top-level form.

`C-C C-A`      Move to the start of the current top-level form.

`M-x repl`     Create an editor-based REPL.

#Swank

This release includes Swank 2016-03-04.
The Swank server is listening on port 4005.

Forwarding for port 4005 will need to be enabled in the virtual
machine's settings. In VirtualBox this is done throught the port
forwarding settings, which can be accessed through
Settings -> Network -> Advanced -> Port Forwarding

#Major changes since Demo 1

Many improvements to conformance, stability and performance.
The editor has been greatly improved, thanks to Burton Samograd.
The system now functions correctly on computers with more than 1GB of RAM.
The allocator and garbage collector now make much better use of available
memory, with far fewer GC cycles occuring.
(ROOM T) prints more detailed information about allocated objects.
Transparency and premultiplied alpha support in the GUI.
And more!

#Blinkenlights

A number of status lights are displayed at the top left of the screen.
From left to right:
`Green`        Disk read in progress.

`Cyan`         Activity, system is not idle.

`Yellow`       Snapshot in progress.

`Brown`        Page fault being serviced.

`Light Green`  Network activity.

* The entire top line will turn red if the system panics.

#Memory Monitor

The memory monitor displays a bitmap indicating how each page of physical memory
is used. Colours indicate type.
`Blue`         Free memory.

`Red`          Wired memory.

`Brown`        Wired backing memory, used during a snapshot.

`Green`        Active in-use memory.

#Experimental whole-system transparent persistence support

You might wreck your install if you try using this feature.
Take a snapshot using your virtual machine before using it, or back up your disk.

Close all running programs (optional, strongly recommended).
Run `(mezzano.supervisor:snapshot)` in a REPL.
Wait for the yellow light to turn off.
Reboot.

If the system does not boot properly then restore your backup and try again.



Development continues!
